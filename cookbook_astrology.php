Similarly, if you separately read the dynamics between your Rising, Sun, Moon and Venus Signs, they might all have their own contradictory meaning. Understanding how the ingredients of your compatibility all "bake" together is the job of an astrologer. What you\'re about to read, we affectionately refer to as "Cook Book Astrology." For a more in depth understanding of your compatibility, please consult an astrologer.</p></div>';
