    <br><br>
    Below are instructions on how to find your time of birth.  If you'd like skip this step for now, close this window, click the "Done" button and we'll remind you later.
    <br><br>
    The first place to check is your “long form” birth certificate.  The “short form” does not include your birth time.  If you don’t have your long form birth certificate, there is a good chance one of your parents or a legal guardian does!  Ask your mother, father, or legal guardian and see if they have a record of your birth time.  If they don’t have it, ask them if they recorded your birth time in a baby book, family bible, or journal.  
    <br><br>
    We highly recommend that you DON’T guess.  If your parents or legal guardians are “pretty sure” you were born “around 6am”, please be sure to find out how far off they might be.  Once you have a good idea of how accurate or inaccurate the estimate might be, please use our “Accuracy of Time” function so that we can determine how much your astrological birth chart may have changed during the window of time you provide to us.  This way we can provide you with as many accurate astrological placements as possible.
    <br><br>
    If you can’t find your birth certificate and your parents or legal guardian(s) don’t have any record of your birth time don’t despair!  There are several other options.
    <br><br>
    The county in which you were born will have an “Office of Vital Statistics”, “Department of Vital Records”, “Birth and Death Records”, or similar office.  By performing an Internet search for one of these offices in connection with your birth location you should be able to find the appropriate office. (e.g. Google search: office of vital statistics Fairfield Iowa).  The county office should have your birth certificate on file.
    <br><br>
    If you want to go the commercial route, there are businesses that will hunt down your birth certificate for you such as www.vitalchek.com*.  If you use a company like this make sure to order your full birth certificate sometimes referred to as “Birth Long”, or “Birth Full”.  
    <br><br>
    Contacting the hospital where you were born is an option.  However, they send their records to the local office that stores birth records, so they may not keep birth records themselves.  
    <br><br>
    If you were born at home, ask your parents or a legal guardian for the name of the midwife who delivered you.  Midwives fill out a birth certificate form and send it to the local office that stores birth records just like hospitals do.  However, they may keep a log of births they have been involved in which may include your birth time.
