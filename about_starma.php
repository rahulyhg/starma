    <br><br>
    <p>At Starma, we strive to provide a unique astrological service – free in depth astrology made simple.   Astrology is a complex field, and we’ve found that a lot of astrological content is either overly simple, defining you solely by your Sun Sign, or overly complicated, including astrological lingo and symbols the majority of us don’t understand.  We’ve tried to tackle these issues by providing a more in depth look at your Birth Chart in language that’s easier to understand, and we’ve included fun visual aids as well.</p>  
	<p>By joining Starma, you’ll not only have access to your own Birth Chart, but to the Birth Charts of friends, family members and celebrities as well.  You can even see how your Birth Charts work together in a more in depth look at astrological compatibility.  To see examples of how our site operates, click Explore Starma.  Please enjoy our site, and contact us if you encounter any problems.  We’re still under construction, and strive to improve your experience.</p>
